# libpaillier
C++ Library for the Paillier homomorphic cryptosystem. Scripts support building library for iOS via Xcode CLT.

## Disclaimer
This was originally part of a larger project, but I moved it to a seperate repo after that project fell apart. It's been a while since I've worked on this project, so if there are any bugs I forgot about, submit an issue and let me know.

**This is probably a project that you want to look at, but never use. I can guarantee no security.**

This project is loosly based on `python-pailler`, docs available [here](https://python-paillier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).

## Libraries Used
This utilizes GMP, gmpfrxx, and MPFR.
